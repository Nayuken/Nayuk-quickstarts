Name:
Game studio quickstart

Motivation:
Nobody wants to play a laggy game, and downtime and performance issues on game servers can result in steep financial losses for game companies.  In order to quickly identify and resolve problems with your games, itâ€™s important to continuously monitor them with tools such as New Relic.

Description:
A simple quickstart to allow game developers to be able to quickly access a fully functional dashboard with events and metrics related to common developer needs. This quickstart dashboard includes a performance tab which houses the vitals of the host server which includes CPU usage, Memory usage, errors rate by function and average server response time. The developer tab is home to game transactions which includes build time, asset load time and memory leaks. The final part of the dashboard is demographic information where player based information is displayed, this tab includes player logins, player count over time, platform players are playing on, language choice used, and country.
